## Story Synopsis
Jules has an highly active imagination and a fascination for minutia, and their plush sidekick Germs is always game for adventure.  Their favorite place in the world is on mama's farm where they can escape into the microcosms that blossom between the rows.  When trouble strikes in Ant Queendom, Jules and Germs hop into action and stand in solidarity with their micro-pals.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to write Outside Jules for a number of reasons.  I have been wanting to write and illustrate a story for a long time and writing has always been more challenging for me.  

I was inspired by my 4 year old's fascination with bugs and microbial life and his imagination.  He helped me to get back to that curiosity and playfulness that I had as a child and that opened the door for Jules to come through.  

I wrote Jules as a non-binary character because that is how I identify, and it wasn't until my mid-thirties that I put that together for myself.  I want to explore what life can be for a child with the full freedom self-acceptance and expression.  I want children to see that and the child-me wants to see that too.

I wrote Jules as a black character because several years ago a peruvian artist friend of mine made me aware of the rarity that white artists draw or depict subjects of color.  I started looking for occurences of BIPOC characters in my favorite white artist's work, and talking with other white artists about their relationship to subjects of color in their artwork.  So, creating Jules and their mama as BIPOC characters was opportunity in equal parts: personal challenge, exploration of my own internalized racism, and to research and learn more about black culture and experience.
## Project Status

I am currently stalled on this one.  I went ham on the first issue and once I got it finished I needed to take a break.  I know where I want the story to go to, but I don't quite know how to get there yet.  This is a hurdle in my writing journey that I am working to get over, and it is only a matter of time and effort.
